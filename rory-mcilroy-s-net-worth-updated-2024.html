success on the PGA Tour, Watson has also had success on the over-50 Champions Tour, where he has won 14 times and six major championships.</p><p>As of January 2024, Tom Watson’s net worth is estimated to be $25 Million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tom-watson-facts></span>Tom Watson Facts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Tom Watson was the first golfer to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1977 after winning the Masters Tournament.</li><li>Watson is successful as a golf course designer, having created The Bull at Pinehurst Farms in Wisconsin and The Ranch Course at Cordillera in Colorado.</li><li>He has a passion for history and has written a book about the history of golf called “The Soul of the Game: Golf’s Greatest Players and Moments.”</li><li>In 2010, Watson was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame as a member of the PGA Tour category.</li><li>Watson led the American Ryder Cup team in Scotland in 2014.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span>Early Life&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thomas Sturges Warson was <a href=# rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Watson_(golfer) data-lasso-id=122490 data-wpel-link=external>born September 4, 1949</a>, in Kansas City, Missouri, United States.</p><p>When Tom was just four years old, he played golf with his father and developed a passion for the game.</p><p>At the Kansas City Country Club, he was introduced to coach Stan Thirsk and started honing his skills.</p><p>Tom went to Pembroke Country-Day School, where he played on his high school team and achieved exceptional performances that earned him acclaim in the community.</p><p>He next enrolled at Stanford University, where Watson eventually earned a psychology degree in 1971.</p><p>Tom won the Missouri State Amateur titles four times, in 1967, 1968, 1970, and 1971, before beginning his professional career.</p><p>Watson’s professional career began in 1974, but at first, he battled greatly to produce outcomes similar to those of his amateur years.</p><p>But in 1974, he became friends with Byron Nelson, who later served as his coach, and with his help, Tom was able to win his first championship at the Western Open.</p><p>Once he had his first victory under his belt, Watson continued to have success, and in 1975, he won the Open Championship.</p><p>He is one of only four players since the Second World War to do so – the others are Ben Hogan (1953), Tony Lema (1964), and Ben Curtis (2003).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tom’s first Masters Championship victory in 1977 significantly enhanced his net worth and earned him the Vardon Trophy, as well as the title of PGA Player of the Year.</p><p>In 1978 and 1979, he won the Vardon Trophy again, getting close to the <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/richest-golfers-world/ data-lasso-id=122491 data-wpel-link=internal>richest golfers in the world</a> and having the highest scoring average for a PGA year.</p><p>In 1980, he won his third Open Championship and was voted PGA Player of the Year for the fourth time, increasing his marketability.</p><p>His US Open victory in 1982 and his second Open Championship win the following year further boosted his earnings and solidified his reputation as an exceptional golfer.</p><p>However, his performance began to decline in the late 1980s, and, despite using some of the <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/most-expensive-golf-clubs/ data-lasso-id=122492 data-wpel-link=internal>most expensive golf clubs in the world</a>, he only won a few smaller tournaments.</p><p>Despite this, Tom’s overall victories still place him among the top golfers in history, with only <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/tiger-woods-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=122493 data-wpel-link=internal>Tiger Woods</a>, Ben Hogan, Walter Hagen, <a href=# rel=noopener

data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/jack-nicklaus-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=122495 data-wpel-link=internal>Jack Nicklaus</a> having more victories.</p><p>Since joining the Champions Tour in 1999, Tom has competed in a limited number of tournaments and has achieved 14 victories, including six senior majors.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tom-watsons-career-earnings></span>Tom Watson’s Career Earnings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tom has a competitive, quick-moving game, having won 39 times on the PGA Tour and now mostly competes on the over-50 Champions Tour.</p><p>He has won 14 additional times, including six PGA TOUR Champions major championships.</p><p>Now that Tom Watson is retired, there are no official records of how much he earns annually, so it is not possible to confirm his annual income.</p><p>Watson was one of the best golfers in the world during the 1970s and 1980s, winning eight major championships and five times topping the PGA Tour money list.</p><p>From 1978 to 1982, he held the top spot in McCormack’s World Golf Rankings; in both 1983 and 1984, he was rated second only to Seve Ballesteros, the Spanish champion.</p><p>He is one of only a handful of players including, <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/dustin-johnson-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=122496 data-wpel-link=internal>Dustin Johnson</a>
