Unfortunately, <a href=#>they split up</a> less than five months after little Jason was born. There were plenty of rumors at the time of their split that big Jason’s philandering was the cause of his split with Jena. However, even despite his wandering dong breaking up their home, Jena and Jason have been co-parenting well.</p><p>Last week, Jena decided to post a photo of herself looking amazing in a bikini to Instagram and added an affirmation that read, “You are beautiful, you are worth it and YOU are irreplaceable. Don’t forget that.” Words I think we could all say to ourselves every once in a while, right? Some person replied in the grossest way possible, calling little Jason a bastard, Jena a wh*** and accusing her of having her “morals mixed up.” Although Jena owed this troll nothing, she did reply and told them – and everyone else – that she doesn’t deserve to be lied to by anyone and will “never be OK with sharing a lover.”</p><p>Jena Frumes clapped back at an Instagram follower Thursday after the person questioned her worth.</p><p>The model and actress, 28, who shares a 13-month-old son with singer Jason Derulo, 32, posted a bikini photo while in her home and captioned it, “You are beautiful, you are worth it and YOU are irreplaceable. Don’t forget that.”</p><p>A follower replied, “Worth it in what way?” before commenting on Frumes’ split from Derulo. “You’re not married, which means your child is a bastard and you’re playing the w—- role. Y’all got morals mixed up.”</p><p>Frumes was quick to comment back, and said, “I wouldn’t call myself a w—- its unfortunate situation didn’t work out because we once did aspire to be married but maybe it’s best to be single than to be in a relationship & constantly be disrespected & cheated on and lied to. Or is it better to stay quiet so people like you approve?”</p><p>Frumes later shared a longer message on her Instagram story, noting that all she wanted with Derulo was “a family to love and experience life with,” but claiming his alleged cheating and disrespect got in the way of that.</p><p>“Women really don’t deserve to be treated and judged the way they are. No one aspires to be a single mom. It’s the biggest heartbreak and failure for me personally knowing I’m alone in this…But if your non-negotiables are being tested you’ll never find peace in that relationship,” she wrote.</p><p>“If a man wants a different girl every week over his family I’ll never accept that…we will never be able to make it work ‘happily,’ was straight up told that I should ‘turn the other cheek.’ I’ll never be OK with sharing a lover that I love with all my heart!!!” the influencer continued.</p><p>Frumes went into further detail about Derulo’s reported unfaithfulness, and said, “If the streets come first I can’t change that so stop blaming the women like we chose the single mother life. That s— is hella annoying. You don’t know what women go through to try & ‘make it work.’ It was never about money or dating someone famous…I was in love & we planned a baby & life together! It didn’t work out and life must go on. Leave me alone.”</p><p><a href=#>[From People]</a></p><p>“Women really don’t deserve to be treated and judged the way they are.” I mean, yeah. Jena splits with her baby’s father because he can’t be faithful, leaving her to do what is likely the bulk of the child’s care and she’s the one being accusing of mixed-up morals? Nobody who hasn’t willingly agreed to an open relationship needs to be “OK” with sharing a lover. More so, no one should have to stand by and accept their lover lying to and disrespecting them because of some antiquated notion of what family means.</p><p>Obviously, Jena had a few things to get out there and was emotional in her comments. There are women who do, in fact, plan to raise children as single mothers and that’s perfectly acceptable as well. My guess is this is not the first name Jena has been called by Big Jason’s fans. And she’s hurt. She’s hurt because she was planning a life with him as she said. Hurt because he chose his rock star lifestyle over their family (and it sounds like he did so many, many times). And hurt because these strangers online are calling her terrible names for daring to feel good about herself and her choices when she’s the wronged party. It doesn’t surprise many of us that Jason cheated on his partner. But Jena trusted him, and he broke that trust. She moved on for herself and for her son. She should be commended.</p><p>You know, not much surprises me these days but calling a single mother out for “playing the w****” in 2022 is right up there. This is shameful.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcG9jbn5xe8maqqimj5mys8HLqKqYnaiUt6a6wJidq62dmsCgtcullqedppq%2FoK7EmKakl6eewamr0qGYq6GenKyiq8uorZ6qXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./margaret-whitton-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Margaret Whitton Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr;
