So, Dhani should have expected his father’s response in dreamland.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/George-Harrisons-Son-Dhani-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-george-harrison-s-son-dhani-knew-about-spirituality-at-a-young-age>George Harrison’s son, Dhani, knew about spirituality at a young age</h2><p id=par-4_18>When Dhani was growing up, George <a href=#>didn’t hold back on telling him things</a> no matter his age.</p><p id=par-5_24>In an interview with the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Associated Press</a>, Olivia said she’s “constantly surprised” to hear Dhani talk about things she didn’t know George had told him.</p><p id=par-6_55>“Whether it was something for history’s sake, or a mantra, or some lesson, I thought, he didn’t wait until (Dhani) was 30 or 40,” Olivia said. “That’s a real lesson, too. Why do we hold back? Why are we so constrained by time? George didn’t live like that. Maybe he was prescient. Maybe he knew.”</p><p id=par-7_14>George always said everything he wanted to say and&nbsp;<a href=#>lived in the here and now</a>.</p><p id=par-8_45>“One of his favorite things to say was, ‘Be here now,'” Olivia told the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LA Times</a>. “Sometimes he and Dhani would be talking and Dhani would ask, ‘Well what if this happens?’ or ‘What if that happens?’ George would say, ‘Be here now. Be here now.'”</p><p id=par-9_45>In Martin Scorsese’s documentary, George Harrison: Living in the Material World, Dhani explained that his father didn’t have a scar on his body when he died; he was like a yogi. Dhani knew that his father’s death wasn’t final. George was around all the time.</p><p id=par-10_22>He once said, “They’re all there, all&nbsp;our loved ones and all our friends and relatives; everybody is all there in their astral&nbsp;bodies.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>George’s son, Dhani, said he had something typical to say in a dream</h2><p id=par-11_35>In Scorsese’s documentary, Dhani explained he’d once had a dream about his father. George gave him a typical George response. The documentary producers asked Dhani <a href=#>what he’d say to George</a> if he were around today.</p><p id=par-12_46>Dhani responded, “‘Where have you been?’ I had a dream that I saw him,” Dhani explained. “That was what I said to him in the dream. So, I guess that’s what would be the question, wouldn’t it? ‘Where have you been… since I last saw you?’</p><p id=par-13_30>“And he answered it. So, I can tell you the answer as well, which was, ‘Here the whole time.’ Which doesn’t really help me in any way, but, you know.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dhani wasn’t the only one who dreamt of the former Beatle</h2><p id=par-14_27>George’s son isn’t the only one who dreams of him. His former bandmate, Paul McCartney, has revealed more than once that he often dreams of George.</p><p id=par-15_16>In 2018, he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC Radio Scotland</a> that he once dreamt that The Beatles had reunited.</p><p id=par-16_72>“As a musician, you <a href=#>often have dreams about being in the studio</a> or on stage so I’m often with the guys,” Paul said. “Just the other morning, I woke up and I was with&nbsp;George. And that was very nice. I think of George as my little mate – he was the youngest in the group. That’s how I run into&nbsp;John&nbsp;and George these days. So the Beatles have re-formed – in my head.”</p><p id=par-17_18>George left a lasting impression on his loved ones and the world. However, he never truly left us.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS0prvRoJxmoJGnv6q%2FzqeqZqufo3qltMCnoGarkZ6xbrLArZ%2Beql2ovK6x06Ggp59dqcaxtcKao2arka56pb7EmqRnoKSiuXA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-snowfall-star-damson-idris-married-and-what-is-his-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is 'Snowfall' Star Damson Idris Married, and What Is His Net Worth?">&larr;
