Businessmen, politicians, celebrities, and even academics were caught up in the hedonism of Epstein's life. Epstein was a giver who freely shared his lavish lifestyle with his pals. He flew friends to his island in St. Thomas, threw decadent dinner parties at his Manhattan townhouse, and spared no expense or indulgence. He was also in the habit of hiring underage girls to give him $200 massages before he sexually assaulted them. He was arrested for this in 2008 and got off with a literal slap on the wrist. However, he was arrested again a few days ago and hopefully, this time, the sex trafficking of minors charges will stick.</p><p>Along the way, Epstein picked up a number of famous friends, including former <a href=#>President Bill Clinton</a>. It has been known for some time that Clinton and Epstein were pals and that Clinton flew on the billionaire pedophiles private jet. Now, it turns out, that flight logs show that the former president took at least 26 trips on the "Lolita Express," including five in which he reportedly ditched his Secret Service detail.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-284132 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1031446786.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-284132 class=wp-caption-text>Presley Ann/Getty Images</p><p>Previously, it had been reported that<a href=#> Clinton took 11 trips on Epstein's Boeing 727</a>, but it turns out it was more than double that. Trips between 2001 and 2003 went around the world with Epstein and passengers identified on flight manifests by their initials or first names. Epstein's jet gained its nickname due to the fact that it reportedly had a bed onboard where passenger's had sex with young girls.</p><p>Epstein only spent 13 months in prison and on home arrest for solicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution. He allegedly had a team of associates who recruited girls as young as 12 to provide sexual favors to his friends at Epstein's estate on the 72-acre island he owns called Little St. James in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Among friends, the island was called "Orgy Island."</p><p>Virginia Roberts, 32, alleged that Epstein pimped her out when she was 15. She has said in the past that she saw Bill Clinton at Epstein's island estate in 2002. It should be noted, however, that no flight logs show Clinton as a passenger to St. Thomas, the nearest airport large enough for Epstein's plane to land. Flight logs do reveal that Clinton was a passenger on Epstein's jet when it flew to Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, China, London, Brunei, the Azores, Norway, Africa, Russia, Belgium, and New York.</p><p>The official flight logs filed with the FAA show that Bill Clinton traveled on some of the trips with as many as 10 Secret Service agents. Then there the May 22-25, 2002, five-leg trip to Asia that Bill Clinton was on but not a single Secret Service agent was. The former president would have been required to file a form to dismiss his agents. It is not clear whether or not this was done. However, the U.S. Secret Service told Fox News that it has no records showing that any Secret Service Agents were ever on Epstein's island with Clinton.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfl7atuIyco6KmpKS7bsPArGSaZaCWwLSxzaCcq2Wfo3qrscWfqZ6xXZq9tMDEoqWsZaCntret055ko52kYq61ecuemKysXWeDbsDIppysZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./david-spade-53-dates-women-who-are-so-young-they-don-t-know-led-zeppelin.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="David Spade, 53, dates women who are so young they dont know Led Zeppelin">&larr;
