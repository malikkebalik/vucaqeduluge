While starring as Hayley Vaughn on the long running soap, "All My Children", Kelly Ripa became one half of soap opera's most beloved couples. Her chemistry with onscreen love interest, Mark Consuelos, the actor who played Mateo Santos, proved to be real, and the two were married a year after they began working together on the show. While completing her final season with "All My Children", she was invited to audition as co-host for the morning show formerly known as "Live with Regis and Kathie Lee". Her audition was a success, and in 2001, "Live with Regis and Kelly" premiered.&nbsp; The revamped morning program was an almost instant hit, and has remained a ratings juggernaut even after the retirement and death of Regis. She hosted a variation of the show with <a href=#>Michael Strahan</a> and now hosts alongside <a href=#>Ryan Seacrest</a> on "Live with Regis and Kelly." For her work on the show Kelly Ripa's annual salary is $22 million.</p><p>In addition to her hosting duties, she also starred on the popular sitcom, "Hope & Faith" from 2003 to 2006.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Kelly Maria Ripa was born on October 2, 1970 in Berlin, New Jersey.

They became known for opening up on-air about their personal and family lives. Their viewership averaged around 6 million viewers per day.</p><p>Kelly became the head of the show when Philbin retired in January 2011, and had a various string of guest co-hosts when the show was known as Live! with Kelly.

In 2017, Ryan Seacrest became her new co-host and the show's title was changed to Live! with Kelly and Ryan.

The unit contained a massive eat-in kitchen with multiple refrigerators, a separate family wing with a pair of bedrooms and a playroom, a library/den, an office, and a personal gym.&nbsp; The family enjoyed that location so much, that when they outgrew the $2.8 million loft, they moved upstairs to the 9,865 square foot penthouse suite that had recently been vacated by <a href=# title="Nicole Kidman Net Worth">Nicole Kidman</a>. They paid $9 million in 2005 for Kidman's 6,700 square foot property. They eventually sold the first condo for around $6.8 million, a $3 million profit.

The five-story home has an elevator that takes people up to a private rooftop patio and garden. For vacations, they have a ski home in Telluride, Colorado and a beach home in the Hamptons. The couple bought their Hamptons home for $2.35 million in 2004. It's likely that this home is worth $10-15 million today. Their combined real estate portfolio is worth at least $45 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLimuMuyZKuhoJZ6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./michelle-stafford-biography-age-height-husband-net-worth-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michelle Stafford Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family">&larr;
