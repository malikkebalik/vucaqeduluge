On June 19, 2003, Williams was injured after he crashed his motorcycle into a streetlight in Chicago while not wearing a helmet. He wasn't licensed to ride a motorcycle in the state, and the act violated his contract with the Bulls. Jay suffered a fractured pelvis, and the accident severed a nerve in his leg and tore three ligaments in his knee. Due to the fact that Williams would require lengthy physical therapy in order to use his leg again, the Bulls decided to waive him.

After being waived from the Toros, Williams announced that he wasn't planning to return to his basketball career. During his professional basketball career, Jay also played on the senior USA national basketball team, which came in sixth at the 2002 FIBA World Cup.
