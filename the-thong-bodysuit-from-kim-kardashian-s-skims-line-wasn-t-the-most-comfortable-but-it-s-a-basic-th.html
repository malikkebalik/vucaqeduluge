I</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>On February 18, I tried to reorder the Long Sleeve Crew Neck Thong Bodysuit in the color Onyx but it was sold out, so I had to settle for the Tigers Eye color.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>I ordered a new bodysuit in the color Tigers Eye since Onyx was sold out. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Celia Fernandez/Insider</span></span></figure><p>Considering most of the products SKIMS releases sell out within a few days, I shouldn't have been surprised that I wasn't going to be able to order the same bodysuit again.</p><p>The only bodysuits that were available in the 2X/3X size were Sandstone and Tigers Eye. Since I already knew the L/XL size was too small, I went up a size and prayed to the fashion gods that I wouldn't have any issues again. I also decided to order the Tigers Eye color because I didn't like that <a href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noindex" data-am-orig-url="https://affiliate.insider.com/?h=748414c9fb69b3965d289c04aed525566210926f52953f06bfbf6d0459f831b0&u=https%3A%2F%2Fskims.com%2Fproducts%2Flong-sleeve-crew-neck-thong-bodysuit-sandstone" data-analytics-module=body_link>the Sandstone looked a bit yellow</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>On February 19, I got an email that my new bodysuit had shipped and I had it in my hands two days later, on February 21.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Just like with previous purchases, I got my order within a few days. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Celia Fernandez/Insider</span></span></figure><p>Within four days of ordering a new bodysuit, I was able to get my hands on the new one.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>The new bodysuit arrived in similar packaging.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>The bodysuit came in a bigger box this time. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Celia Fernandez/Insider</span></span></figure><p>Finally, I would have the chance to test out the SKIMS bodysuit.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>Just like the packaging says, the bodysuit felt exactly like a second skin.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>The 2X/3X size was the perfect fit for me. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Celia Fernandez/Insider</span></span></figure><p>I was afraid that I was going to look like a tan blob in the bodysuit because I thought the color was too similar to my skin, but it turned out to be a bit darker in person, which I was so happy about.&nbsp;</p><p>Going up a size was the best decision and made me realize that these bodysuits run between small and true-to-size, which is something to consider if you're looking to buy one.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>The worst thing about the bodysuit was the thong design.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>I am used to wearing thongs but this was uncomfortable on another level. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Celia Fernandez/Insider</span></span></figure><p>The design feature I was looking forward to the most when trying on the bodysuit was the snap closure because it meant I could use the bathroom without having to deal with the hooks that most bodysuits I own come with.&nbsp;</p><p>The snap closure turned out to be my least favorite part of the bodysuit, as it was constantly riding up to the point where I was uncomfortable and could not have it on all day. Whenever I was sitting down, I found myself wiggling around in order to move the closure a bit without having to run to the bathroom constantly to fix it.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>Despite the hassle over the return, I think the bodysuit is a nice basic to have in my wardrobe.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>I will be wearing underwear underneath my bodysuit from now on. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Celia Fernandez/Insider</span></span></figure><p>The point of the thong bodysuit is to wear it without underwear, but I couldn't deal with having the snap closure riding up all day, so I will be wearing it with something underneath from now on.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite that, I think the bodysuit is a great addition to my closet because I can dress it up or dress it down. It was comfortable on top and made me feel sexy because I felt like it smoothed over my skin and accentuated my waist.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're someone who loves to have bodysuits in your closet, I would highly suggest the SKIMS piece. Although the next time I buy one, it won't be a thong version.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>It's important to follow the wash instructions, as I noticed pilling after I threw the bodysuit in the machine with the rest of my laundry.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>The SKIMS website says their bodysuits should be hand-washed in cold water. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Celia Fernandez/Insider</span></span></figure><p>The SKIMS website says to hand-wash the bodysuit in cold water and not to tumble dry. I don't have time to hand-wash the garment, so I threw it in with the rest of my laundry and it held up nicely with one exception: I noticed pilling in one spot on the back of the bodysuit.&nbsp;</p><p>It could be because I dried the bodysuit with the rest of my clothes on high heat for about 45 minutes.</p><p>The next time I wear it, I'm going to follow the instructions and see if there is a difference. I also want to keep an eye on the pilling because, given the price tag, I don't think the fabric should be damaged after one wash.&nbsp;</p><ul class=read-more-links><li>Read more:</li><li><a href=# data-read-more-link data-e2e-name=read-more-link rel data-analytics-module=body_link>I spent $140 on Kim Kardashian's fuzzy loungewear items and found out the hard way that they are not easy to wear</a></li><li><a href=# data-read-more-link data-e2e-name=read-more-link rel data-analytics-module=body_link>A woman made her own version of a $268 pajama set from Kim Kardashian's brand Skims using a $25 blanket</a></li><li><a href=# data-read-more-link data-e2e-name=read-more-link rel data-analytics-module=body_link>Kim Kardashian hinted that there might be SKIMS shapewear for men in the works</a></li><li><a href=# data-read-more-link data-e2e-name=read-more-link rel data-analytics-module=body_link>Kim Kardashian shared photos of times she 'taped up' her breasts to show people how to use her new body tape</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSoqWeq6Oeu7S1w56pZ5ufonystcxmopqqlJbAqbXAp2Sso5miwG7Ax6iloGWSpLG6v9Siq2aqlau2psOMa2draF1o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./viggo-mortenson-and-vincent-cassel-back-for-eastern-promises-2-without-david-cronenberg.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Viggo Mortenson And Vincent Cassel Back For Eastern Promises 2 Without David Cronenberg">&larr;
