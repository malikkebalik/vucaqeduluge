Their purported crime? Embezzling 3 billion pesos from the Mexican Ministry of the Interior. FYI, 3 billion pesos is equal to around <span style=color:red><strong>$146 million</strong></span>.</p><p>If even remotely true, it's a stunning story, made even more salacious because Inés and her husband may be hiding out in Miami.</p><p>From what I can tell, prior to last week Inés Gómez Mont was basically unknown even in Mexico. She appears to be a fairly obscure periodic TV host/sideline reporter. Her only major headline came in 2008 when she wore a wedding dress to a press event ahead of Super Bowl XLII and loudly begged <a href=#>Tom Brady</a> to marry her.</p><p>Here's a video of their exchange and a photo from later that day:</p><p></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-324434 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ines-1.jpg alt width=900 height=1350 sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-324434 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Scott Halleran/Getty Images)</p><p>Fast forward to the present.</p><p>Some details that were not clear last week have now been released.</p><p>According to Mexican criminal justice authorities, between 2016 and 2017 Inés and lawyer husband Victor Alvarez Puga allegedly used a company called Inteligencia Cibernetica to filter 3 billion pesos from Mexico's Ministry of the Interior through a series shell corporations then did not provide any services. Allegedly. According to reports this week, Inteligencia Cibernetica was supposed to provide electronic security systems at seven Mexican prisons.</p><p>According to a court document, those services were never rendered:</p><p><strong>"…However, that did not happen, as the equipment never reached the prisons being that the (ministry) officials diverted the money to the aforementioned company in a corrupt and illegal way (and) being that it had to be used for improvements in the security of the prison system."</strong></p><p>Again – according to the court documents – the couple used several other reportedly "bogus" companies to create invoices for security services that were never actually rendered.</p><p>The couple was apparently just charged with misuse of public funds, organized crime and operations with resources of illicit origins. A Mexico state judge approved arrest warrants for the couple and 10 former officials who were also allegedly part of the scheme.</p><p>Inés and Victor, who have not been seen since September 10, could face 20 to 60 years in prison a piece if they are captured and convicted.</p><p>Inés Gómez Mont just came out swinging against the charges. Here is her full statement which was posted to Instagram:</p><p><strong>"I have been silent for a few days to try to understand the facts attributed to me and to focus on my defense. Despite not having access to the file, I want to emphasize that I am innocent and have not committed any crime.</strong></p><p><strong>Indeed, according to the press, the authorities accuse me of allegedly having received money from two public contracts (totaling 3 billion pesos) and of belonging to organized crime. Those facts are absolutely false. That is, without any justification they place me on the same level as a drug dealer or terrorist. It seems to me an injustice.</strong></p><p><strong>To be clear, I have never stolen a peso. Nor have I received money from those contracts, much less have I seen or had 3 billion pesos in my life. I'm a full-time mom and TV host. And under no circumstances do I belong to organized crime.</strong></p><p><strong>I also have well-founded fear that derived from this statement that the authorities in charge of my case will be even more cruel against me, since I have been warned of more cases fabricated against me. But I can't keep silent anymore. On the contrary, I will continue to work with my legal team to be able to defend myself and always honestly share the details of my case with them.</strong></p><p><strong>To everyone who knows me and who I am, thank you for your support and love.</strong></p><p><strong>To those who do not know me and have heard premature judgments against me, I respectfully ask for your vote of confidence.</strong></p><p><strong>I know who I am. For myself and my children, I will demonstrate my innocence with dignity and I will not keep silent. I repeat: I am innocent and this is an injustice.</strong></p><p><strong>THANK YOU"</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJona6fmam2t7GMppyxoZOWu27A1WafqKukYsSpu4yao6Wdl5qxrcWMnqSbnaqvuaawjGprb2Wdnrmttc6nZJ%2Bqn6J6tbTEZqSesJmYrq95xqitnqqeorKvwIyco5qhnah6qrrNqJqeppOaeqq6jKKlrKyRnL%2BiuYyppqysXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./stefanie-gurzanski-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stefanie Gurzanski Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More">&larr;
