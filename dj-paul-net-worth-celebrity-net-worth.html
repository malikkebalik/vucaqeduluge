Dunigan, known by his stage name Lord Infamous. Lacking equipment, the pair rented the studio of the local DJ Just Born. The Serial Killaz went on to release self-recorded tapes in their neighborhood and school, with their first, "Portrait of a Serial Killa," coming out in 1992. Following this, the duo released a self-titled tape, and two parts of "Come with Me 2 Hell."</p><p>Eventually, Paul purchased studio equipment, and began making mixtapes and selling them at his high school.

More success came with 2003's "Da Unbreakables" and 2005's "Most Known Unknown," both of which cracked the top five of the Billboard 200.
