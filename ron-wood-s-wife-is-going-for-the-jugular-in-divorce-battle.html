Credit: WENN</p><p>Rolling Stones guitarist Ron Wood’s long suffering wife, Jo, is mad as hell and she’s hitting her estranged husband where it hurts: his wallet. When Ron, 61, publicly humilated Jo this summer by taking up with a 19-year-old cocktail waitress while he was supposed to be in rehab for alcohol, he basically opened himself up to an all-out war – and now, it looks like that’s what he’s getting, to the tune of 50 million pounds or $92 million USD.</p><p>Ronnie Wood faces a £50million divorce pay-out after his wife Jo called in lawyers in exasperation at his continuing relationship with a Russian 20-year-old.</p><p>Friends have revealed how humiliated Jo has taken legal advice about the break-down of her 23-year marriage and is understood to have been told she is in a ‘terrifically strong position’.</p><p>Apart from taking half of Wood’s £75 million fortune in the split, Jo, 53, is also believed to be angling for a portion of the Rolling Stones guitarist’s future earnings since she has consistently saved his career from disappearing into a haze of drink and drugs.</p><p>The revelation came as Wood, 61, was photographed enjoying a romantic meal with young Russian Ekaterina Ivanova at the fashionable London restaurant Locanda Locatelli…</p><p>Wife Jo is now understood to be gunning for up to half his fortune, plus as much as a further 20 per cent on top of that for the years of work she has put in as his executive assistant.</p><p>Jo has proven indispensable to him over the years he has spent in the band.</p><p>She has gone on every tour with him since they first met, picking out his outfits and cooking him organic food.</p><p>She has also been pivotal in his business success. She has a controlling stake in the couple’s finances and acts as her husband’s personal management assistant on deals.</p><p>She is also a joint director of his music empire Rockyarch and company secretary of Wood’s paintings business Scream Art.</p><p>The couple have a range of enormous homes around the world, including a £12 million mansion in Kingston upon Thames, a castle in Clane, County Kildare worth £4.5 million and a £250,000 cottage in Devon….</p><p>Wood’s relationship with Miss Ivanova shows no signs of slowing down. He currently appears to be spending most of his time with Katia at the flat he rents in Hampstead, north London.</p><p>He has already moved many personal possessions— including his easels and art equipment—from his marital home in Kingston to his new flat.</p><p>A friend added: ‘Everyone has painted Kat as a wild child but she was supporting Ronnie through rehab. She is committed to helping him remain sober…</p><p>‘I know Jo was hoping he would dump Katia and return home but that is not going to happen.’</p><p><a href=#>[From The Daily Mail]</a></p><p>The nausea-inducing line in this article: “Between courses Ekaterina affectionately cupped Wood’s face in her hands. She then lovingly spoon-fed him ice-cream.” Blech! I can’t imagine cupping that face in my hands. That whole scene must have looked like some young girl feeding her grandpa his dessert. When are these old men going to learn that sticking your wrinkled, 60-year-old penis into a 20-year old does not, by default, make you a 20-year-old again? It’s completely pathetic and a total cliche. And Jo deserves every penny.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i153.photobucket.com/albums/s218/celebitchy/08septembera/wenn5154277.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmamxka31wvs6nlrCnn5nAoMPIn5yYoaOUtLC1zaCWn6eilMGpsb6jrKCtnJa%2FoLXNmJuirp%2BnsKarwZqrraSVZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-miami-plastic-surgeon-is-the-boob-god.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Miami Plastic Surgeon Is The &amp;quot;Boob God&amp;quot;">&larr;
