RiceGum is known for his numerous diss tracks, vlogs, and online feuds with other YouTubers. Since creating his main channel on the video-sharing site in 2012, he has amassed over ten million subscribers and more than two billion views. As a rapper, RiceGum had his biggest commercial success with his 2017 debut single "It's Every Night Sis," featuring fellow YouTuber <a href=# title="Alissa Violet Net Worth">Alissa Violet</a>.</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>RiceGum, whose real name is Bryan Quang Le, was born on November 19, 1996 in Las Vegas, Nevada. He is of Chinese and Vietnamese ancestry. As a teenager, Le went to Sierra Vista High School in Spring Valley, where he played on the school basketball team. He went on to attend the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, but dropped out during his freshman year to focus full-time on his online career.</p><h2 id=youtube-career><strong>YouTube Career</strong></h2><p>Le launched his main YouTube channel, RiceGum, in 2012; the name would become his moniker. He soon became notorious for his many online feuds with other YouTubers, including iDubbbz, James Rallison, Bhad Bhabie, and <a href=# title="Gabbie Hanna Net Worth">Gabbie Hanna</a>. The lattermost personality accused RiceGum of hitting her and shattering her phone at a party in 2017. RiceGum has also been involved in a number of controversies related to his YouTube videos. In mid-2018, he drew major flak for a video he uploaded of himself in Hong Kong in which he asked patrons and staff at a local McDonald's if they had dog on the menu. RiceGum was heard in the video declaring that "Asians eat cats and dogs in China." The video was widely decried for being culturally disrespectful and ignorant, and was eventually removed from YouTube. RiceGum defended himself by saying he was merely "joking around," an apology that was regarded as insincere by many observers.</p><p>RiceGum generated more controversy in early 2019 when he and <a href=# title="Jake Paul Net Worth">Jake Paul</a> promoted the website MysteryBrand, which promised to offer users prizes but failed to follow through. As part of his apology, RiceGum gave away Amazon gift card codes to users who had been scammed by MysteryBrand; however, it turned out many of the codes had expired. RiceGum got into more hot water in 2021 when he partnered with the esports and entertainment group FaZe Clan to promote the Save the Kids token, a purported charity cryptocurrency token that ended up being a pump-and-dump scheme. Despite his many controversies, or maybe because of them, RiceGum has amassed over ten million subscribers and more than two billion total views on his main YouTube channel. He also has two other channels, RiceLive and FamilyGum.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-334339 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/RiceGum.jpg alt="RiceGum Net Worth" width=900 height=817 sizes="(max-width: 1720px) 100vw, 1720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-334339 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by GP/Star Max/GC Images)</p><h2 id=music-career><strong>Music Career</strong></h2><p>As a rapper, RiceGum began releasing singles in 2017. His first charting single was also his debut: "It's Every Night Sis," featuring fellow YouTuber Alissa Violet. A response track to YouTuber Jake Paul's viral song "It's Everyday Bro," the single debuted at number 80 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number 55 on the Canadian Hot 100. It would later go Platinum. "It's Every Night Sis" was followed by the singles "God Church" and "Frick da Police," the latter a diss track toward YouTuber iDubbbz. "Frick da Police" reached number 45 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number 67 on the Canadian Hot 100.</p><p>RiceGum closed out 2017 with the release of the Christmas song "Naughty or Nice." Early the next year, he released the songs "Bitcoin" and "Fortnite n Chill." RiceGum's other songs have included "DaAdult," "My Ex," and "Contract Money Freestyle," all of which came out in 2020. He also made a guest appearance in the video for fellow rapper and YouTuber <a href=# title="KSI Net Worth">KSI</a>'s song "Earthquake," although the video was later removed from YouTube following a dispute he had with KSI.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>RiceGum is in a relationship with Ellerie Marie. At the end of April in 2023, in his first new YouTube video in over two years, he announced that he and Marie had lost a child to stillbirth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70qKloJ2iqHyztcKenq6lXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cassie-randolph-on-friendship-with-caelynn-miller-keyes-our-lives-aren-t-as-intertwined.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cassie Randolph on Friendship With Caelynn Miller-Keyes, Our Lives Arent as Intertwined">&larr;
