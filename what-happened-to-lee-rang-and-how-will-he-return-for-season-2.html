The drama focused on a 100-year-old gumiho, Lee Yeon (Lee Dong-wook), who remeets his reincarnated love. Intermixed in the story is his half-brother, who harbors resentment toward him. With <a href=#>Tale of the Nine-Tailed Season 2 confirmed</a>, the character Lee Rang (Kim Bum) is set to return after his tragic demise and reincarnation in the first season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Kim-Bum-as-Lee-Rang-in-Tale-of-the-Nine-Tailed-K-drama.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lee-rang-sacrifices-himself-for-his-brother-s-happiness-in-tale-of-the-nine-tailed>Lee Rang sacrifices himself for his brother’s happiness in ‘Tale of the Nine-Tailed’</h2><p id=par-2_61>To understand the character Lee Rang, fans have to know his backstory. Lee Rang is half gumiho and was born to a mother who wanted nothing to do with him. Lee Yeon took him in as a child. When Lee Yeon gives up his position as the mountain spirit of&nbsp;Baekdudaegan for a woman, Lee Rang feels abandoned by his only family.</p><p id=par-3_58>In Tale of the Nine-Tailed Episode 4, fans see a flashback of his past. Lee Rang goes on a killing rampage, murdering humans. He is angered at his brother for abanding him and allowing humans to set fire to the mountains. Lee Yeon is told to murder his brother to be sentenced by the gods for his crimes.</p><p id=par-4_54>The K-drama later focuses on Lee Rang’s reincarnation in the present time. Still angered as Lee Yeon, Lee Rang makes his mission to make his brother’s life a living hell and stop him from meeting his long-lost love. He even helps the enemy bring back Imoogi, an earth dragon who will end the world.</p><p id=par-5_70>By the finale of the K-drama, Lee Yeon sacrifices himself to stop Imoogi and save everyone. In the aftermath, Lee Rang looks for ways to bring back his brother through reincarnation. He makes a barter with the Lord of the Underworld. Having forgiven his brother and found his own family, he is a viable candidate and gives up his life for Lee Yeon to be with his true love.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Tale of the Nine-Tailed’ Season 2 will bring back Lee Rang from the past</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_44>As Lee Rang turned over a new leaf in Tale of the Nine-Tailed, the gods show mercy and have him reincarnated as a young boy with a loving mother. But <a href=#>Tale of the Nine-Tailed Season 2</a> will bring back the character another way.</p><p id=par-7_68>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Soompi</a>, the second season will take place in 1938. Lee Yeon is forced to return to the past but looks for a way to return home. Actor Kim will reprise his role as Lee Rang. But for this storyline, fans will remeet the character in a version from the past. In 1938, Lee Rang still harbored resentment toward his brother and was in a rebellious stage.</p><p id=par-8_53>Meeting Lee Yeon from the future creates an important relationship in Tale of the Nine-Tailed 1938 with Lee Rang. The character is a drastically different character in the future compared to the past. Fans can likely expect Lee Yeon to feel sentiment toward his brother and try to mend their broken relationship.</p><p id=par-9_39>But Lee Yeon interfering with Lee Rang could lead to a conundrum in the cause and effect of messing with the past. Fans must also remember that Lee Rang was reincarnated as a young boy in the present.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Actor Kim Bum recently finished a medical K-drama before starring in ‘Tale of the Nine-Tailed’ Season 2</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_65>After Kim’s role as Lee Rang in <a href=#>the fantasy K-drama</a>, he starred in a riveting legal K-drama on Netflix. In 2021, he played the role of Han Joon-hwi in Law School. Joon-hwi is a law student with perfect grades who gets involved in trying to solve the murder of a school professor. With the help of his classmates, they look for the real culprit.</p><p id=par-11_48>Soon after Law School, Kim recently starred in Ghost Doctor alongside actor and idol Rain. He plays the role of Go Seung-tak, a 1st-year thoracic surgery resident. He comes from money and privilege with immense medical knowledge. But is incapable of performing procedures due to a traumatic past.</p><p id=par-12_40>When the hospital’s genius cardiothoracic surgeon&nbsp;is in an accident and a coma, his spirit possesses the body of Seung-tak. Ghost Doctor was successful as Kim will start working on Tale of the Nine-Tailed 1938, set to premiere in 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBorjEZqafZaSdsm66yKecZqyRnrmmsIywn5qsXZ2usbzEp5ydZZyasm6%2BwKeeZqCfrHq4tculZKGdXaeytcHRp2SsnZGovK95kWefraWcZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-wolfgang-van-halen-s-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Wolfgang Van Halens net worth?">&larr;
