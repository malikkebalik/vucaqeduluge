He is best known for being a four-time All Star, a recipient of the Silver Slugger Award (2006, 2010, and 2011), as well as being a member of the Yankees World Series championship team in 2009.</p><h2 id=earnings><strong>Earnings</strong></h2><p>During his first 15 years in Major League Baseball, Can√≥ earned a little under $200 million in salary alone. He is one of the 20 highest-earning baseball players of all time. His earnings in that period would have been a bit higher, but in November 2020 Robinson was suspended from the 2021 season after failing a PED test. The suspension will cost him at least $24 million in salary. It was his second PED suspension. Robinson was previously suspended for 80 games in 2018.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Robinson Can√≥ was born on October 22, 1982 in San Pedro de Macoris, Dominican Republic. Robinson was named after legendary baseball player <a href=# title="Jackie Robinson Net Worth">Jackie Robinson</a>. Robinson's father Jose Can√≥ was a baseball player who pitched in six games for the Houston Astros in 1989. Robinson attended Barringer High School in Newark, New Jersey for one year and then attended San Pedro Apostol High School in San Pedro de Marcos back in the Dominican Republic. Can√≥ played for both the school's baseball and basketball teams. Can√≥ eventually played for his hometown team the Estrellas Orientales in the Dominican Winter Baseball League.</p><h2 id=minor-leagues><strong>Minor Leagues</strong></h2><p>After Can√≥ graduated from high school, on January 5, 2001 he was signed by the Yankees baseball organization. He came to the team as an amateur free agent, receiving a significant signing bonus of over $100,000.</p><p>Can√≥ made his minor league debut with the Gulf Coast Yankees, playing at the rookie-level for the Gulf Coast League as a Staten Island Yankee (Class-A Short Season New York‚ÄìPenn League). Can√≥ would play for various minor league teams, including Staten Island and the Greensboro Bats (Class-A South Atlantic League) during their 2002 season. Can√≥ would go on to play for the Tampa Yankees of (Class-A Advanced Florida State League), and the Trenton Thunder (Class-AA Eastern League) for the 2003 season. By this time, after significant minor league play, Can√≥ was starting to be considered as a top prospect for the majors. Can√≥ also made an appearance during the 2003 All-Star Futures Game, further solidifying his position as a top major league prospect.</p><h2 id=mlb><strong>MLB</strong></h2><p>Can√≥ got call to the big leagues on May 3, 2005. He took over second base, a position previously held by Tony Womack. On May 5 of that same year, Can√≥ earned his first ever professional-level base hit (off of notable <a href=# title="Hideo Nomo Net Worth">Hideo Nomo</a>, pitcher for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays).</p><p>Can√≥ also recorded his first career grand slam as an MLB player during his inaugural pro season. Can√≥ finished second in the American League Rookie of the Year race, finishing behind in balloting to Huston Street of the Oakland Athletics. In 2005, Yankees manager <a href=# title="Joe Torre Net Worth">Joe Torre</a> made a comparison that stuck with Can√≥, comparing Can√≥ to popular Hall of Famer Rod Carew. Torre would go on to expand on this statement, making remarks about Can√≥'s strong presence at the plate and the smoothness of his swing.</p><p>In 2009, Can√≥ earneda .320 batting average, 204 hits, 25 home runs and 85 RBIs. Can√≥ earned a ranking among the top ten American league players when it came to hits, at bats, total bases, batting average, doubles, runs scored, as well as triples. That would also be Can√≥'s first year when he'd hit over 20 home runs. With his 200th hit (against the red-hot Boston Red Sox) he helped the Yanks clinch the AL East Division. He and <a href=# title="Derek Jeter Net Worth">Derek Jeter</a> then became the first middle infield pair in MLB history to both record 200 hits during the same season.</p><p>Can√≥'s 204 hits ranked him at third in the hits category for the 2009 season. Can√≥ was also first ranked among all second basemen in the major league and also led second basemen in the batting average category. Can√≥ played in 161 games that season, which ended up being the most games played by a single player during the 2009 season. Can√≥ also hit his first career walk-off home run during his 2009 season, which was a 3-run walk-off home run (August 28 against the White Sox). On November 4, Can√≥ would also throw out <a href=# title="Shane Victorino Net Worth">Shane Victorino</a>, which ended up being the final out of a Yankee 2009 World Series championship.</p><p>Can√≥ would continue to play as a Yankee through the 2013 season. Can√≥ then became a Seattle Mariner (2014-2018), followed by the New York Mets player ahead of the 2019 season.</p><p>On November 18, 2020, Can√≥ would end up getting suspended for an entire 162-game season after testing positive for Stanozolol, which was in direct violation of the MLB's performance-enhancing drugs policy. This rendered Can√≥ as ineligible for his entire 2021 season. This would also be Can√≥'s second time testing positive for a performance enhancing drug, which came at a serious cost to Can√≥'s reputation and legacy.</p><h2 id=contracts><strong>Contracts</strong></h2><p>Can√≥ played for the Yankees from 2006 to 2013. From 2014 to 2018 he played for the Seattle Mariners. Upon joining the Mariners, Robinson signed a 10-year $240 million contract. Ahead of the 2019 season, Robinson was traded to the New York Mets. His performance with the Mets was subpar. On May 2, 2022 the Mets announced that they were cutting Can√≥. With the decision, the Mets agreed to continue paying Robinson roughly $20 million per year for two years. In other words, they decided to pay him $40 million to NOT play for them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNkv6qvx56qrWWSlsCmrsClo2iqn5e2r7%2FOp2ScmZ6keq%2Bx02auqKqknXw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./will-the-merc-don-his-famous-x-force-suit-in-deadpool-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Will The Merc Don His Famous X-Force Suit In Deadpool 2?">&larr;
