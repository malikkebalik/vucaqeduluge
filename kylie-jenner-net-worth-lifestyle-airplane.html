It can go from rest to 60 in just under 3 seconds and hit 186 miles per hour in 12.1 seconds.</p><h4>Lamborghini</h4><p>Kylie purchased the first and orange Lamborghini Aventador in 2018 for about $400,000. It is the mid-range car of Kylie’s garage, given by its price tag.</p><p>The car has a 6.5 liters L539 V12 engine that produces 770 brake horsepower and 780-pound feet of torque.</p><p>This is the first Lamborghini she ever got but not the last.</p><p>Recently she added another beast of a car Urus to her collection. The car is in red color and the mogul splashed well over $200,000 for it.</p><p>Urus is an SUV from the bulls and is a popular model among celebrities.</p><p>Despite being an SUV, this Red Bull can reach the top speed of 190 miles per hour.</p><p>It takes Urus just 3.2 seconds to reach 60 miles an hour from rest.</p><h4>Mercedes-Benz</h4><p>Enough with fast and hypercars.</p><p>It’s time for Big Daddy. Yeah, this is what I like to call them.</p><p>Kylie has three of these Big Daddy in her garage and obviously in three different colors.</p><p>When you are super rich this is what you do; you redo the car’s paint job as per the season.</p><p>And Kylie did the same thing but only to match her G Wagon with her Lamborghini Aventador for summer 2018.</p><p>She redid the paint job of her Mercedes-Benz G wagon to Orange.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Kylies-Merc-Lambo.jpg><p>When she purchased this truck, she paid over $150,000, and the custom paint job for a truck this big can go upwards of $10,000.</p><p>The truck was black previously.</p><p>She also has a tan-colored G Wagon.</p><p>Similarly, Kylie purchased another maroon G- Wagon after she broke up with Tyga in 2017.</p><p>Mercedes-Benz G Wagon is known for its signature bold looks and luxury.</p><p>However, G Wagon’s are not the only model of Mercedes-Bens Kylie owns.</p><p>Reportedly, her then-boyfriend Tyga gifted her super expensive Mercedes-Benz Maybach for her 19th birthday in 2016. This luxury wheel costs over $200,000.</p><h4>Rolls Royce</h4><p>Kylie owns not one, not two, but four cars from the British automaker Rolls Royce with Rolls Royce Cullinan being the most recent purchase.</p><p>Kylie added a black exterior and all custom pink interior Rolls Royce Cullinan, which she calls an ultimate mom car.</p><p>A normal Cullinan costs over $330,000, but the price might have been hyped with Kylie’s custom requests.</p><p>She’s eve added “Stormi’s mom” on the rocker panel of the SUV.</p><p>Similarly, another Rolls Royce she owns is ice blue 2018 Ghost. She purchased the car in December 2018.</p><p>Both interior and exterior are colored Ice Blue. At the time, she referred to it as her “dream car.”</p><p>Just like her Cullinan, she has engrained her name on the rocker plate of the car.</p><p>A standard Ghost can cost around $315,000, but the price can go way up to half a million with customization.</p><p>Apart from Cullinan and Ghost, Kylie owns Taupe Rolls Royce Ghost.</p><p>But we are not sure because Kylie is fond of repainting her cars, and it can be assumed these are likely the same car.</p><p>Nonetheless, the car costs over $330,000.</p><p>Another interesting Rolls Royce she owns is a vintage one. Reportedly, her then-boyfriend Travis Scott gifted this classic Rolls Royce to her.</p><p>These classic Rolls Royce’s can cost a bank-breaking amount, and Travis must’ve struck a deal with a dealer to buy it.</p><p>The vintage beauty is probably a late 1950s or mid-1960s model Rolls Royce.</p><h4>Ferrari</h4><p>Apart from all her Rolls Royce’s and Mercedes, Kylie owns a couple of Ferrari’s, with LaFerrari being the most famous and rare one.</p><p>Travis Scott also gifted the LaFerrari.
