Over five seasons, viewers have watched as cast members navigate the complicated business of having multiple partners. Some relationships work, while others crash and burn. But <a href=#>what happens when the cameras go away</a>? Here’s where things stand with the cast in May 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dannielle-and-garrick-merrifield>Dannielle and Garrick Merrifield&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-2_72>Dannielle and Garrick’s relationship with potential sister wife Roberta fell apart in season 4, but that didn’t put the Colorado couple off the idea of polygamy. In season 5, Garrick pursued a new romance with a Brazilian woman named Nathalia. But just as Garrick was preparing to legally marry Nathalia so that he could bring her to the U.S., life threw him a curveball. Dannielle was unexpectedly pregnant with their third child.</p><p id=par-3_29><a href=#>Dannielle and Garrick’s daughter</a> Leia was born in May 2023. The couple are still living in Colorado. Dannielle occasionally shares updates on her life and daughter on her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_64>In May 20 episode of Seeking Sister Wife, Garrick revealed that he was trying to get a K-1 fiance visa for Nathalia after a judge in Brazil refused to marry them because of the Merrifields plural lifestyle. Meanwhile, the couple is getting to know a woman named Mariam, who is from Michigan. The status of their relationships with both Nathalia and Mariam is unclear.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shane-and-ashley-sherwood>Shane and Ashley Sherwood</h2><p id=par-5_47>Shane and Ashley Sherwood joined Seeking Sister Wife in season 5. The Massachusetts couple was hoping to add another wife to their family. Ashley, who is bisexual, clicked with a woman named Sarah. But Sarah didn’t have much of a connection with Shane, which was a concern.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_56>Ashley and Shane’s journey was complicated by the fact that Ashley was pregnant with their second child and Shane had cancer. While things didn’t work out with Sara, Ashley and Shane are still together. She gave birth to their baby in October 2023. In May 2024, Shane shared on social media that he was now cancer-free.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-davis-family>The Davis family&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_83>Most Seeking Sister Wife Season 5 cast members have yet to find women who are willing to become part of a polygamous family. That’s not the case for the Davis family. Nick Davis has three wives – April, Jennifer, and Danielle – and is hoping to add a fourth. In the May 20 episode, Nick and his wives invited a woman named Jasmine on an overnight date at their home. But Danielle was not entirely comfortable with adding another woman to the family.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_32>Fans will have to wait and see how things play out for the Davis family.
