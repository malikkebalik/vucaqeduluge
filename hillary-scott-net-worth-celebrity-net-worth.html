She has a sister 14 years her junior named Rylee. As a kid, Scott was initially homeschooled on the road with her parents. For elementary and high school, she went to Donelson Christian Academy, from which she graduated in 2004. It was after she joined her mother on stage for a Christmas show that Scott realized she wanted to pursue a career in music. For her higher education, she attended Middle Tennessee State University.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>While a student at MTSU, Scott worked with singer-songwriter Victoria Shaw, garnering some publicity but not enough to land a record deal. She also had two unsuccessful auditions for "American Idol." Scott soon met <a href=#>Charles Kelley</a>, and then <a href=#>Dave Haywood</a>, who would become her future bandmates. The trio subsequently wrote its first song, "All We'd Ever Need."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-264229 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Hillary-Scott.jpg alt width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-264229 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=lady-a><strong>Lady A</strong></h2><p>Lady A, formerly known as Lady Antebellum, was formed by Scott, Kelley, and Haywood in 2006. After signing a deal with Capitol Nashville the following year, the band released its debut single, "Love Don't Live Here." In 2008, the group released its self-titled debut album, which entered the Top Country Albums chart at number one. Singles from the album included "Lookin' for a Good Time" and "I Run to You," the latter of which became the group's first number-one hit on the Hot Country Songs chart. The band had an even greater success with the 2009 single "Need You Now," the lead single from the album of the same name. Topping the Hot Country Songs chart for five weeks, it later peaked at number one on the Adult Contemporary chart and at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. Meanwhile, the album on which it appeared debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and went on to win five Grammy Awards.</p><p>Lady A had its next smash hit with the 2011 single "Just a Kiss," the first single from its third studio album, "Own the Night." The album also spawned the hit singles "We Owned the Night" and "Dancin' Away with My Heart." In 2012, the band released its first Christmas album, "On This Winter's Night." That was followed by the album "Golden," which launched the hit single "Downtown," and "747," which featured the hit single "Bartender." Subsequent studio albums were "Heart Break," "Ocean," and "What a Song Can Do." In 2020, amid the George Floyd protests and renewed discussion about racism in the US, the band officially changed its name to Lady A to avoid the connotations of "Antebellum" with the American Civil War.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-155342 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Hillary-Scott.jpg alt="Hillary Scott" width=594 height=394 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-155342 class=wp-caption-text>Getty images</p><h2 id=other-music-projects-collaborations><strong>Other Music Projects and Collaborations</strong></h2><p>Scott's biggest music project beyond Lady A has been her collaboration with her family. With her father, mother, and sister, she released the album "Love Remains" in 2016. Incorporating aspects of gospel, country, and bluegrass, the album features both original material written by Scott and gospel standards. "Love Remains" was a substantial success, debuting at number seven on the Billboard 200 and winning Grammy Awards for Best Contemporary Christian Music Album and Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song for "Thy Will."</p><p>Scott has collaborated with a variety of other artists over the years, including <a href=# title="Luke Bryan Net Worth">Luke Bryan</a>, <a href=# title="Dave Barnes Net Worth">Dave Barnes</a>, and Maroon 5.
